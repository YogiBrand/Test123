# Workflow Designer

A powerful visual workflow builder for creating automation workflows with drag-and-drop functionality.

## üöÄ Features

### Visual Workflow Builder
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Intuitive visual editor for building workflows
- **Node-Based System**: Connect different types of nodes to create complex automations
- **Real-time Preview**: See your workflow in action as you build it
- **Multiple Node Types**: Triggers, actions, conditions, functions, and more

### Node Types
- **Triggers**: Start workflows based on events or schedules
- **Actions**: Perform operations like API calls, data processing
- **Conditions**: Add branching logic to your workflows
- **Functions**: Execute custom JavaScript code
- **Delays**: Add time-based delays between operations
- **Fan Out**: Process arrays and iterate over data

### Production-Ready Features
- **Persistent Storage**: Workflows saved locally with Zustand
- **Real-time Updates**: Live workflow execution status
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout the application

## üõ† Setup Instructions

### Installation & Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## üèó Architecture

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **ReactFlow** for the visual workflow editor
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Zustand** for state management
- **Lucide React** for icons

### Workflow System
- **Node-based Architecture**: Each step is a node with inputs/outputs
- **Edge Connections**: Visual connections between nodes define flow
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for all workflow components
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new node types and integrations

## üìä Workflow Components

### Core Node Types
1. **Trigger Nodes** - Start workflows
2. **Action Nodes** - Perform operations
3. **Logic Nodes** - Conditional branching
4. **Utility Nodes** - Helper functions
5. **Integration Nodes** - Connect to external services

### Workflow Features
- **Visual Editor**: Drag-and-drop workflow builder
- **Real-time Validation**: Instant feedback on workflow structure
- **Execution Engine**: Run workflows with status tracking
- **Configuration Panels**: Detailed settings for each node
- **Template Library**: Pre-built node templates

## üîß Development

### Adding New Node Types
1. Define node type in `src/types/workflow.ts`
2. Create node component in `src/components/workflow/nodes/`
3. Add to node library in `NodeLibrary.tsx`
4. Update configuration panel in `NodeConfigPanel.tsx`

### Customization
- Modify node types in workflow types
- Customize UI components in `src/components/workflow/`
- Adjust styling with Tailwind classes
- Add custom node logic and validation
